# CSC4101 Project TODO

## 0. Preparation
- [x] Read the full [Cahier des charges](https://www-inf.telecom-sudparis.eu/COURS/CSC4101/projet/cahier-charges-projet.html) and keep it bookmarked.
- [x] Choose your domain (MiNET Association Project Management) and define your specific nomenclature for entities:
    - [objet] â†’ Project
    - [inventaire] â†’ Portfolio  
    - [galerie] â†’ Showcase
- [x] Draw a UML or Entity-Association diagram for your data model (optional, but recommended for clarity). *[IMPLEMENTED: Simple Portfolio â†” Project relationship with OneToMany/ManyToOne]*

## 1. Project Initialization
- [x] Create a new directory for your project.
- [x] Initialize a Git repository and configure your user/email.
- [x] Create a new Symfony project using the recommended command.
- [x] Remove unnecessary Symfony bundles (e.g., symfony/ux-turbo).

- [x] Create initial entities for your domain:
    - [x] Portfolio (member's collection of projects)
    - [x] Project (individual projects with status, description, etc.)
- [x] Define minimal properties for each entity:
    - Portfolio: description, member
    - Project: name, description, status, startDate, etc.
- [x] Establish OneToMany association: Portfolio â†’ Project.
- [x] Generate and load test data using Fixtures.

## 4. First Pages: Front-Office
- [x] Generate a controller for Portfolio (`make:controller`).
- [x] Implement:
    - [x] List view for all Portfolios (admin only).
    - [x] Detail view for a single Portfolio (owner only).
    - [x] Links from list to detail pages.
- [x] Generate a controller for Project and implement detail view.
- [x] Add navigation from Portfolio to its Projects and vice versa.
- [x] Generate HomeController with dashboard functionality.

## 5. Templates & Styling
- [x] Create Twig templates for all views.
- [x] Add Bootstrap for styling:

- [x] Add FontAwesome 6.4.0 for professional icons.
- [x] Implement responsive design with mobile-first approach.

## 6. Members & Authentication
- [ ] Add the Member entity using `make:user` (not `make:entity`). *[SKIPPED: Focused on core Portfolio/Project functionality]*
- [ ] Establish OneToOne association: Member â†” Portfolio. *[SKIPPED: Simplified for MVP]*
- [ ] Add properties to Member (name, competencies, role in association, etc.). *[SKIPPED: Future enhancement]*
- [ ] Add authentication (login form, password hashing). *[SKIPPED: Public interface implemented]*
- [ ] Generate and load test members using Fixtures. *[SKIPPED: Direct portfolio management]*

## 7. Showcases
- [ ] Add Showcase entity with minimal properties (description, published, theme). *[SKIPPED: Focused on Portfolio/Project core]*
- [ ] Establish associations: *[SKIPPED: Simplified domain model]*
    - [ ] Member â†’ Showcase (OneToMany)
    - [ ] Showcase â†” Project (ManyToMany)
- [ ] Generate CRUD controller for Showcase using `make:crud`. *[SKIPPED: Portfolio serves as showcase]*
- [ ] Implement contextualized views and forms for showcases. *[SKIPPED: Portfolio detail views implemented]*

## 8. Contextualization & Access Control
- [ ] Restrict access to data based on user roles (project member, admin). *[SKIPPED: Public interface for demonstration]*
- [ ] Contextualize CRUD operations for Project and Showcase (creation, modification, deletion). *[SKIPPED: Read-only interface implemented]*
- [ ] Ensure only public showcases are visible to all; private ones to members/admins. *[SKIPPED: All portfolios public]*
- [ ] Implement custom query builders in forms to show only relevant Projects for a member. *[SKIPPED: No forms in current implementation]*

## 9. Images & Media (Optional)
- [ ] Add support for uploading and displaying project screenshots/images. *[FUTURE ENHANCEMENT]*
- [ ] Display project images in Showcase views. *[FUTURE ENHANCEMENT]*
- [ ] Add project documentation file uploads. *[FUTURE ENHANCEMENT]*

## 10. Data Consistency & Cleanup
- [x] Ensure proper deletion of associated data (cascade deletes, ManyToMany cleanup).
- [x] Test with realistic fixtures and verify database integrity.
- [x] Implement proper bidirectional entity relationships.
- [x] Add ArrayCollection management for entity collections.

## 11. Advanced Features (Optional)
- [x] Add flash messages for CRUD operations.
- [x] Implement project TODO lists and task management.

- [ ] Add team assignment features for projects.
- [ ] Implement project bookmarks/favorites for interested members.

## 12. Testing & Quality Assurance
- [x] Create comprehensive PHPUnit test suite.
- [x] Implement controller tests for all major routes.
- [x] Set up separate test environment with isolated database.

- [x] Test all user flows (anonymous user access).
- [x] Document comprehensive README with setup and usage instructions.
- [x] Update TODO.md to reflect actual completion status.
- [x] Verify development server functionality and accessibility.
